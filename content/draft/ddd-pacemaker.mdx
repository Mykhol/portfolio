### What is a DDD Pacemaker?

Pacemakers are a marvel of human ingenuity and engineering, allowing people's whose heart no longer function properly to be supported to such an extend that people can live almost completely normal lives with them.

The first pacemaker was implanted in 1958 and whilst the technology has evolved the same basic principle remains the same: wires are implanted inside the heart and electric singals are sent to the heart to trigger it to beat when the heart is beating slower than normal. 

The diagram below taken from [] shows a timing diagram for an implanted DDD pacemaker system.
