# An Introduction

I'm not sure about you, but working part-time and studying uni takes up a lot of my time. When I am inspired to work on project or build a new tool that can help me in my personal life, I always get stuck on the very mundane and boring aspects of the build.

The obvious solution here is that I use some common parts between different projects and applications I build.

Being an opinionated developer - whoops - I didn't even think to search for repositories out there already, instead I've jumped in and built my own based on my experince with Next.js and the associated stack I have been using both professional and personally.

## The Stack

- Next.js
- Auth.js
- TailwindCSS
- Prisma
